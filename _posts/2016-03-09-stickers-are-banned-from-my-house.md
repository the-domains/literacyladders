"Don't let my daughter see those sticker books! Stickers are banned from my house!"

Whoa! I was shocked and taken aback by this mom's very strong reaction to the sticker book I was showing her.

Rather than take that opportunity to explain why sticker books foster reading skills, I put the sticker book away and showed her some other fantastic books.

After all, I thought, there are lots of other ways to develop and strengthen those skills sticker books teach. I'll just suggest some of those instead.

So I did.

But I kept thinking about our conversation.

And it bugged me. Sticker books are so much more than just mindless fun.

Don't you hate it when you think of all those things you should have said hours or days after you should have said them?

What I should have said was something like this:

"Perhaps you ban stickers from your house because Molly sticks them everywhere they shouldn't be. That often happens when children get stickers from the dentist, or promotional stickers of some kind. But our sticker books are different. May I show you why?"

Assuming she said yes, I'd continue.

"For example, let's use this[Sticker Dolly Dressing Around the World][0]book.

See how there is a tidbit about Austria, where this girl is from?

And this page of stickers for Molly to stick on the Austria page?

When Molly peels a sticker and places it in the appointed spot on the page, she is exercising her creative thinking, reasoning, and understanding through matching and association. Molly knows that skirts are placed at the waistline, and blouses at the shoulders. She's activating her prior knowledge about how clothing is worn, choosing an aesthetically pleasing outfit, and learning new details about Austrian traditional dress. By peeling a sticker and placing it where it should go, she is also developing and honing her fine motor skills as well as her hand-eye coordination. All these skills are essential in reading and writing when she's ready.

And Molly's enjoying herself! She isn't aware that she's learning; she's just having fun."

I hope that this explanation would help Molly's mom reconsider her blanket sticker ban.

Are you convinced? Would you be willing to allow your child to play with a sticker book in her area of interest?
